12.0.0
------

 * When assigning a network to the public network and not to
   the cluster network the network specification of the public
   network will be used for the cluster network as well.
   In older versions this would lead to cluster services
   being bound to 0.0.0.0:<port>, thus making the
   cluster service even more publicly available than the
   public services. When only specifying a cluster network it
   will still result in the public services binding to 0.0.0.0.

*  Some variants of the omap_get_keys and omap_get_vals librados
   functions have been deprecated in favor of omap_get_vals2 and
   omap_get_keys2.  The new methods include an output argument
   indicating whether there are additional keys left to fetch.
   Previously this had to be inferred from the requested key count vs
   the number of keys returned, but this breaks with new OSD-side
   limits on the number of keys or bytes that can be returned by a
   single omap request.  These limits were introduced by kraken but
   are effectively disabled by default (by setting a very large limit
   of 1 GB) because users of the newly deprecated interface cannot
   tell whether they should fetch more keys or not.  In the case of
   the standalone calls in the C++ interface
   (IoCtx::get_omap_{keys,vals}), librados has been updated to loop on
   the client side to provide a correct result via multiple calls to
   the OSD.  In the case of the methods used for building
   multi-operation transactions, however, client-side looping is not
   practical, and the methods have been deprecated.  Note that use of
   either the IoCtx methods on older librados versions or the
   deprecated methods on any version of librados will lead to
   incomplete results if/when the new OSD limits are enabled.
